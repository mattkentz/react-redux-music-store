## Intro

A music store app built to learn and experiment with React and Redux. 

Technologies used to build this app:
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to kickstart the project
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) to create the app components
* [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) for navigating between pages
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to manage the application state
* [Redux Logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) for logging state changes
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to dispatch actions asynchronously
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for building everything and live reloading during development

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

** Note **
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `index.html` is the page template;
* `favicon.ico` is the icon you see in the browser tab;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
